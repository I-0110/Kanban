# KANBAN

## Description

Our Kanban is inspired by the need of being set goals and being organized during a project. We created this project because we were having issues to focus on complete main/highly important tasks that needed to be done inmediately. We resolved uncertainly and frustration of time management and setting a goal with this website. We learned that we were using four hours out of seven to complete our projects per day. With this website, we are currently using six hours out of seven..
